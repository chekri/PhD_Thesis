# PhD_Thesis
These are the codes used in the examples of my PhD thesis. These programs are written in AUTO-07p, python and Matlab. The examples in part 1 and Part 2 of the thesis pertaining to numerical continuation are performed using AUTO-07p software package. AUTO-07p is an easy to use software package. To install this software package, unzip the provided auto-07p-master.zip file and move to its parent folder. Then configure the files by .\configure . After the successful configuration, 'make all'. Once installed, the codes can be run easily through  auto scripts (auto.filename). To run these scripts, run auto auto.filename in the terminal window. Once, the computation is complete, the solution files are written in a "s.filename" file. These files are analyzed and plotted using python tools provided in the respective folders.
