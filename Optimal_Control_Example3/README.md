This folder contains the codes used for optimization in Example 3 (Section: "Fixed Tip Position with Adjustable Orientation") in Chapter 9 of the thesis. The CTCR maneuvers such that its tip moves to target orientation and its position is constrained. The tip position is constrained by penalizing its deviation from the prescribed point. Navigate to the folder and open the "Optimize_stay_at_point.m" file and run "Optimize_stay_at_point([])" in the command window to start the Optimization task from an initial solution, with stationary solution (i.e., initial control parameters at all time steps). The run can also be started from the known solution "initial_solution" by running "Optimize_stay_at_point(initial_solution)", and in this case, the solution provided should have the same mesh size. Once the run is complete, implement "Animate(output)" to post-process the results from "output".
