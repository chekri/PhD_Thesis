This folder contains the codes used for implementng the examples in Chapter 7. To implement continuation, just run any of the given script files by running the command 'auto filname.auto'. Auto computes the solutions for the given set of parameters (set in constant files c.files) and outputs the solutions as 's.xxx', where xxx is outputfile name. Use the provided python commands to plot the bifucation plots.

1.***Example1_surface.auto***: Continuation when $\alpha^{[2]}_{o}$ is varied for different section lengths $L_{2}$.(section 7.1.2 of thesis)

2.***Example1_surface_load.auto***: Continuation when $\alpha^{[2]}_{o}$ is varied for different section lengths $L_{2}$ with a tip load.(section 7.1.3 of thesis) 

3.***Example2_surface.auto***: Continuation when $\alpha^{[2]}_{o}$ and  $\alpha^{[3]}_{o}$ is varied for different section lengths in a three-tube CTCR.(section 7.2.1 of thesis)

4.***Example3_surface.auto***: Continuation when rotating tip load acts on a CTCR.(section 7.2.2 of thesis)
