This folder contains the codes used for optimization in Example 2 (Section: "Fixed Tip Orientation with Adjustable Position") in Chapter9 of the thesis. The CTCR maneveurs such that its tip moves to target point along a prescribeed path (straight line) and its orientation is constrained. The orientation is constrained either by penalizing its deviation or using path constraints.

1.***Example2a_inverted***: CTCR manuveur with its orientation constrained by penalizing the deviation.
1.***Example2b_inverted***: CTCR manuveur with its orientation constrained by path constraints.
1.***Example2c***: CTCR manuveur to a farther target point with its orientation constrained by path constraints.
