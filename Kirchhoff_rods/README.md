This folder contains the codes used for implementing the examples in Chapter 5. To implement continuation, just run any of the given script files by running the command 'auto filename.auto'. Auto computes the solutions for the given set of parameters (set in constant files c.files) and outputs the solutions as 's.xxx', where xxx is the output file name. Use the provided Python commands to plot the bifurcation plots. The folder "Kirchoff_rods" includes six auto script files, each generating solutions with a different set of parameters.
